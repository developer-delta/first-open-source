This is a simple guestbook for everyone to add their name and [practice forking, cloning, and submitting a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) on an open source project.

The file you're looking at right now is called a markdown file (that's what the `.md` stands for). It's a common for `README` files to be added to the base of a project to give a summary or guide for how the software can be used and/or contributed to. Markdown is similar to HTML in that you can have links, images, bold text and other "markup".

[Here's a markdown cheatsheet!](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

### Open this sucker up in a code editor!

Add whatever you like at the bottom of this file (don't delete somebody else's work!). Something like this:

Whatever you want between the lines! 

# Big words

###### Little words

```

When you're done, submit a PR back to this repo!
